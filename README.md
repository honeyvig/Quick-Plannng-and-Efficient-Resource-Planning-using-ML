# Quick-Plannng-and-Efficient-Resource-Planning-using-ML
Most of my projects revolve around automating certain business flows.
But...
Im looking for someone who has a very strong hands on experience with ML Engineering/Ai ops to:

a) Quickly understand the project and its requirements and its various parts.

b) Breaks down the project into smallest parts and writes a proposal and project outline how to achieve this.

c) Finds as much of existing code as possible publicly available (github, forums, stackoverflow etc)


And thats it. You will not be required to develop or work on the project. Your role would be confined to initial stages only.

if:

- You are up to date with the quickly changing AI/LLM landscape

- You  are extremely resourceful and good at finding information, research and connecting the dots?

- Have strong python/ml engineering backround?
  You like tinkering/playing around and experimenting..


Basically strong planner with strong Ai engineering skills with wizardly research skills. And you like to move fast!
==============
Python script that simulates the outlined role, enabling a Machine Learning (ML) Engineering Consultant/Researcher to analyze a project's requirements and propose a structured plan for achieving its goals. This script includes sections for taking input on project requirements, breaking down tasks, and automating searches for related existing code and resources.
Key Functionalities:

    Requirement Analysis: Takes in user-provided project requirements.
    Task Breakdown: Automatically decomposes the project into smaller parts based on the given input.
    Code Search Automation: Searches GitHub, forums, and other sources for existing code or solutions related to the tasks.
    Report Generation: Outputs a project outline and list of relevant resources.

Features:

    Requirement Input:
        User enters the project details, which are analyzed using OpenAI's API.

    Task Breakdown:
        OpenAI processes the requirements into actionable tasks.

    Resource Search:
        Searches GitHub for top repositories and StackOverflow for relevant discussions.

    Report Generation:
        Outputs a Markdown file (project_report.md) containing:
            Project requirements.
            Task breakdown.
            Links to useful GitHub repositories and StackOverflow threads.

Dependencies:

    OpenAI Python SDK: For task breakdown using GPT-4.

    pip install openai

    GitHub API Access: Use a token for extended rate limits.
    StackOverflow API: No authentication required but limited queries.

Usage:

    Save the script as ml_project_planner.py.
    Run the script:

    python ml_project_planner.py

    Follow the prompts to input project requirements.
